# OsuBot

Plan is to make a low-level interface in C/C++ and then throw at it some machine learning libraries in Python.

Side Note:
I'm using AOB scanning to find the "time since the start of the audio" variable and I'm not entirely sure about supportability on other systems (Maybe for the best).
It is bytecode afterall and it may vary from processor to processor.
